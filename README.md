FPAI PowerMatcher integration
=============================

This project provides the specific agents that are implemented on the FPAI framework to support the basic 4 types of devices. In this way, any device that is correctly connected to the FPAI framework through a resource driver and manager can be use the a PowerMatcher topology.

This implementation also includes an auctioneer that can be used locally on a FPAI instance. This is mostly used for demo purposes, but it can create a small local cluster (e.g. on a single location with all devices connected to 1 server).
